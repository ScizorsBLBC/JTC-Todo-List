Scizors' Todo List for W7D4 Assignment: Walkthrough: Todo App (Flask). Here is a brief overview of my project:

A simple to do list that we created in class. I have modified it in the following ways to complete the assignment:
  - Restyled to go with my personal branding and softer color palette.
  - Changed from an unordered list to bullet point list.

To set up and run the project (I am using MacOS. These commands may differ based on your dev environmemt setup, if you are a Windows user... Good Luck & Godspeed: ask Google, or ChatGPT lol):
  - set up a new directory in VS Code named JTC-Todo-List
  - run these commands in your terminal:
    - git clone https://github.com/ScizorsBLBC/JTC-Todo-List.git
    - setup prerequisties and dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal, or installing from the websites listed while in the JTC-Todo_List directory you just created and cloned the files into:
      - install python3 using the official installer (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
      - check to see if pip was installed automatically by running one fo these comands depending on your dev environment setup:
        - pip --version
          or
        - pip3 --version
      - if that was not installed run one of these commands depending on your dev environment setup:
        - python -m ensurepip --upgrade
          or
        - python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
      - install flask dependencies by running:
        - pip install flask
          or
        - pip3 install flask
      - install sqalchemy dependencies by running:
        - pip install flask_sqlalchemy
          or
        - pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy 
      - run the main file with the foloowing command in your terminal from the /Flask directory:
        - python3 todo.py
      -  Bang your head against the keyboard then continue :-)
      -  install a virtual environment by running this comand:
        - python -m venv .venv
          or
        - python3 -m venv .venv
      - openm a second terminal window and activate virtual enviroment by running this command:
        - source .venv/bin/activate
      - in a browser window enter this into the URl adderss bar:
        - http://127.0.0.1:5000/
       
I kept it simple to ensure that I would be able to complete this project because we moved through this topic so fast and there was not a ton of explanation of the code presented in class. I decided to use similar branding and aesthetics to other websites I have created. I prefer bulleted lists over unordered lists. 

The biggest challenge faced was writing out the steps for the readme prerequisties and installation, as it was presented in a disjointed way in class and not in a way that was easy to follor or replicate. 

I learned about setting up the dev environment for this type of project.
